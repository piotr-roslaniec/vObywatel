Create and manage a smart account using government issued credentials

How it's made
Tell us about how you built this project; the nitty-gritty details. What technologies did you use? How are they pieced together? If you used any partner technologies, how did it benefit your project? Did you do anything particuarly hacky that's notable and worth mentioning?


This project uses vlayer's web proofs to create proofs of credential issuance from government services. We use a SmartAccountFactory contract to gate SmartAccount creation behind web-proof verification. Each new account is guaranteed to be linked to a government id hash.
Please add more information
